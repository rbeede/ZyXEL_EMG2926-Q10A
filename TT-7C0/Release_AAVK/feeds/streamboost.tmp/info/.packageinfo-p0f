Title: p0f: passive fingerprinter
Maintainer: Ryan Nowakowski <rnowakow@qca.qualcomm.com>
Source: p0f-3.06b.tgz
Type: ipkg
Description: 	p0f is a tool that utilizes an array of sophisticated, purely
	passive traffic fingerprinting mechanisms to identify the
	players behind any incidental TCP/IP communications (often
	as little as a single normal SYN) without interfering in
	any way.
