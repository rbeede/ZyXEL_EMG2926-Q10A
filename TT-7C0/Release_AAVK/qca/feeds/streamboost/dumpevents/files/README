The scripts contained here are used to extract and format flow events contained
within the redis db, written there by the Statistics and Events Aggretator
(sea).

Events are currently stored by sea in csv format and these scripts are
responsible for converting the csv into json.

FAQ::

M4?  what?
	Redis supports LUA scripts but with limitations, the biggest of
	which is that global state cannot be modified by scripts.  What
	this means is that you cannot load a script as a module which
	can later be required or included or imported by another script.
	Put another way, Redis has builtin LUA modules such as cjson,
	but you cannot add your own modules.

	The reason include functionality would be nice for us is because
	we store our events into the redis database in a format that
	is not suitable for our external interfaces so we must convert it
	in some way, but we have several scripts that work with this data.
	If a script could include another script, then we could keep our
	conversion routines in one file and then include that file in each
	of the filter_events*.lua scripts thereby achieving good coding
	practices.

	Since we can't include other files, we instead have to copy-paste
	the conversion routines into each script that needs to be able to
	decode events.

	Enter M4.  In order to prevent having multiple copies of these
	functions in our repo, we store them in one file and then use a
	preprocessor to include them from scripts that need it.  This allows
	us to have a single copy of the conversion routine, but keep the
	final lua scripts self-contained as required by Redis.
