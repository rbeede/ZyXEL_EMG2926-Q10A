First_Agreement="Check below to enable your router to receive automatic StreamBoost updates during your initial 3-year manufacturer service term (extendable through the manufacturer). StreamBoost updates may help improve your router's Internet traffic management capabilities. In exchange, your StreamBoost enabled router will send Qualcomm Atheros Inc. anonymous information from your router. If you decline, you can find updates through software or firmware postings from your router's manufacturer."
Second_Agreement="Your StreamBoost enabled router will provide Qualcomm Atheros Inc. with anonymous data transmitted through the router.  Such anonymous data may include small amounts of information when you launch a streaming service (such as video, audio, or gaming) for the purpose of identifying the data structures of service providers (such as NetFlix, Pandora, World of Warcraft and also other cloud-based services). We use this information to help us optimize StreamBoost for you and other StreamBoost users.  We do not use this information to learn the content of what you watch, listen to, download, or play.  Anonymous data also may include information about your router such as available bandwidth, oversubscription conditions (e.g., amount of bandwidth that is being requested exceeds the available bandwidth), and types of connected devices to the router, as well as information about your streaming service usage, such as duration of use and volume of data.  As with any Internet communication, we may receive the IP address your router uses to send information, but we do not retain it."
